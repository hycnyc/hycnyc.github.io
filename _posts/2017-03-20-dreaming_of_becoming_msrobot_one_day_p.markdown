Hello Friends.

*- Why did want to learn coding?*

Where do I begin.. as an art director/ux designer I was frustrated by my limited ability of reading codes when developing apps/website & communication with developers. I tried many times learning from youtube to lynda.com. 
Then one day I finally decided.. Okay time to concur this skill! 
Honestly, Mr.Robot had a huge influence on me. I loved every single episode and dreamed of being Ms.Robot one day.
